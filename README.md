# SpeechRecognition
kinda same as Alexa but somewhat different functionality.
you can try this on any python oriented compiler which is capable of running python version 3.6 or lower as the audio section over here is getting for the python 3.6 version in case if you don't know how to deupgrade in pycharm64 just search it out in google and voila, there you're with your solution. So, in this code I'm majorly dealing with the google speech recognizer and using it for the pyaudio but if you don't want to use google speech recognizer you can change it in the given code and put into the best speech recognizer which you like the most.
In this code, our major areas of focuses are to play a song on youtube by converting the speech(our) into turning it and to open a new tab on the given web browser(google chrome)
and opening and playing of the song on youtube itself but also, you can ask who is "the personality which you want to know about" or where is "the place which you want to go" and so on.
